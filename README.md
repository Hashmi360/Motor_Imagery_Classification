# Motor_Imagery_Classification

Problem Statement#

1.Dataset is ‘Physio Net EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset' with link as https://physionet.org/content/eegmmidb/1.0.0/

2.The chosen ‘Physio Net EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset’ consists of over 1500 one- and two-minute EEG recordings, obtained from 109 volunteers. Subjects performed different motor/imagery tasks while 64-channel EEGs were recorded using the BCI2000 system.

3.Each record represent an EEG recording at different time step.

4.Each feature represent a different EEG channel measured by placing different electrodes on the scalp of the brain.

5.The objective of my project is to classify the motor movement (label=left fist movement or label=right fist movement ) by considering 2 subjects from a pool of 109 subjects in the data.

6.The evaluation metrics chosen are the accuracy, f1 score, precision, recall and the confusion matrix with the heatmap of the same.
